# Generative Wizard

## Introduction
Generative Wizard is an interactive platform for visualizing and interacting with generative art models. It provides a unique experience to explore, interact, and record various artworks programmed in a digital format. This application is ideal for art enthusiasts, students, educators, and professionals seeking an immersive experience in digital art creation.

## Prerequisites
To run Generative Wizard, you can use any local HTTP server. If you don't have one already set up, Node.js can be used to create a simple server, though it's not a requirement.

### Setting Up a Local HTTP Server
1. **Choose a Server**: You may use any preferred local HTTP server. For Node.js:
    - **Download**: Visit the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) to download the installer.
    - **Install**: Run the installer and follow the setup instructions.

2. **Start the Server**: 
   - If using Node.js, install the server globally using npm:
     ```sh
     npm install -g http-server
     ```
   - Run the server in the directory where your application is located:
     ```sh
     http-server
     ```

3. **Access the Application**: Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` (or the appropriate address if using a different server).

## Using the Application
- **Explore Art Models**: Select from a variety of generative art models to view and interact with.
- **Interact**: Each model offers unique interactive features. Experiment with them to alter the visualizations.
- **Record**: Utilize the built-in recording feature to capture and save your interactions with the art.
